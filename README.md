# BATTLESHIP
Battleship is a stretegy type guessing game for one or two players. It is played on ruled grids on which each player's fleets were placed. Each player will be guessing (hitting) where the other player places their fleet. Whoever is able to hit all the other fleets will win.

## Nest Steps
There are a handful of things I still want to work on.
* First, I want to implement a drag and drop system that allows users to drag the ships and drop them in the player grid.
* Implementing an AI algorithm will be one of my biggest goal with this BattleShip game.
* Refactor my code to look better
