# BATTLESHIP
Battleship is a stretegy type guessing game for one or two players. It is played on ruled grids on which each player's fleets were placed. Each player will be guessing (hitting) where the other player places their fleet. Whoever is able to hit all the other fleets will win.


## Getting Started
* Start the game by clicking on the ship you want first placed in your grid. Default direction
for all ships are set to horizontal. You can change your direction by selecting vertical button.
* Place the ships you selected in your grid with no overlapping.
* Once you have placed all your ships, click Finish Placing button. Computer side will generate
and placed their ships which you won't be able see. Select in the grid where you think the ships
are placed.
* If you hit all ships placed in the ai grid, you win. Otherwise, you lose.

## Nest Steps
There are a handful of things I still want to work on.
* First, I want to implement a drag and drop system that allows users to drag the ships and drop them in the player grid.
I did find documentations on drag API but I did not have enough time during my project to understand it well.
* Implementing an AI algorithm will be one of my biggest goal with this BattleShip game. An AI algorithm will essentially
make the computer play smarter and thus have better chance at winning.
* Refactor my code to look more neat.

## Technologies Used
